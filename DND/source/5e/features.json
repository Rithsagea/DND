You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn\u0027t have a flying or swimming speed.\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature\u0027s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can\u0027t use them.\n- When you transform, you assume the beast\u0027s hit points and Hit Dice.

As long as the excess damage doesn\u0027t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren\u0027t knocked unconscious.\n- You can\u0027t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.

However, you can\u0027t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\n- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature\u0027s shape and size.
