While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don\u0027t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don\u0027t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.\nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.\nYour Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.",

    "description": "Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn\u0027t have a flying or swimming speed.\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature\u0027s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can\u0027t use them.\n- When you transform, you assume the beast\u0027s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn\u0027t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren\u0027t knocked unconscious.\n- You can\u0027t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn\u0027t break your concentration on a spell you\u0027ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you\u0027ve already cast.\n- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can\u0027t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\n- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature\u0027s shape and size. Your equipment doesn\u0027t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can\u0027t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.",
