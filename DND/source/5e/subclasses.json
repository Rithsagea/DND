It is a proud and respected vocation.\nCalled abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.",

The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic. The college\u0027s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another.
